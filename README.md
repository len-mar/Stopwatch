This was bootstrapped with Create React App (which is apparently no longer supported, but was functioning nonetheless).

Initially tried hooking up JS code to directly change HTML elements to reflect the stopwatch (also, using the Date() object), but ultimately realized using React hooks and states was more effective and much less verbose.

Struggled with the cleanup functions. Commenting still left to do.
